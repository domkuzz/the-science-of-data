# Motivation

Welcome to **The Science of Data**, a blog about statistical analysis in Python. The goal of this blog is to deepen my understanding of statistical methodologies and share these insights with fellow data enthusiasts.

Along with explaining and illustrating statistical concepts, some of the content will also include case studies, primarily from the medical field.
