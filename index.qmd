## Motivation


Welcome to "The Science of Data"! This blog chronicles my journey through the captivating world of data science. My goal is to document my learning experiences, share valuable resources, and connect with fellow enthusiasts who are passionate about data.

While most of the case studies will focus on the medical field, the insights and methodologies discussed will be applicable across various domains.

Through this platform, I aim to deepen my understanding of statistical methodologies and create a space for sharing and discussing these insights.
