Welcome to **The Science of Data**, a blog about statistics and the understanding of data. The goal of this blog is to make statistical concepts more accessible and intuitive to others. This does not only help others understand the concepts better, but also helps me to learn and grow as a data scientist.

Along with explaining and illustrating statistical concepts, some of the content will also include case studies, primarily from the medical field.  

If you are new to the blog, you can find the latest posts below or start by reading the about page to learn more about me and the blog.


Stick around and I hope you enjoy the content!
