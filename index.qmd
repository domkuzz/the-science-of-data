Welcome to **The Science of Data**, a blog about statistics and the understanding of data. The goal of this blog is to make statistical concepts more accessible to others and explore their potential in a world of ever-growing amounts of data. 

Along with explaining and illustrating statistical concepts, some of the content will also include case studies, primarily from the medical field.
