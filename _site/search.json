    "text": "Welcome to my website! I’m Dom, a passionate researcher with a keen interest in mdedical data and statistical methodologies. This blog is my space to explore concepts and share insights about the fascinating world of data science.\n\nMy journey\nMy path to data science has been anything but straightforward. I began my career as a physical therapist, driven by a passion for helping people recover from injuries. While pursuing my Master’s degree in physical therapy, I took biostatistics and statistical programming courses. Then, I discovered the potential of statistics in health sciences to improve patient outcomes.\nFascinated by the opportunities of statistics and machine learning, I needed to solidify my foundation in programming, mathematics, and statistics, which drove me to pursue a further degree in Computational Life Science. Today, I work as a research associate, using my expertise to develop predictive models and data-driven solutions in computational health. In addition to research, I assist in teaching courses in machine learning, signal processing, and informatics at the undergraduate level.\n\n\nWhat you’ll find here\nOn this blog, you’ll find a mix of:\n\nIn-depth Articles: The articles will cover the core statistical concepts: Descriptive and inferential statistics, predictive modeling, and exploratory data analysis. I am keen on working hands-on with Python and will provide code examples to illustrate concepts.\nCase Studies: Real-world examples of statistical analysis. With my former background in health sciences, the main focus will be on medical data.\nStats by Hand: A series of articles where I will implement statistical concepts from scratch. This will help me and others to understand the underlying mathematics and logic behind statistical methods.\n\n\n\nWhy this Blog\nI started with this blog to provide others with insights into data science and deepen my understanding of statistical methodologies. Early on, I realized the importance of fundamental statistical concepts to adequately understand and interpret data. Through my studies, I found that I need to research and document a topic concisely and precisely to learn effectively. It is when I can explain a concept well enough for others to grasp that I fully understand it myself. This process often involves simplifying complex concepts into well-understandable terms.\nPlease note that the content of this blog reflects my personal opinions and does not represent the views of my employer(s)."
